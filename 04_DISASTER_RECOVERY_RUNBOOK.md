## üîß Recovery Procedures

### Scenario 1: Complete System Outage

**Symptoms:**
- Website returns 5xx errors
- API endpoints unresponsive
- Database connection failures

**Recovery Steps:**

**Step 1: Verify Infrastructure**
```bash
# Check Vercel deployment status
vercel ls --scope=caregrid

# Verify DNS resolution
nslookup caregrid.vercel.app
dig caregrid.vercel.app

# Check CDN status
curl -I https://caregrid.vercel.app
```

**Step 2: Database Recovery**
```bash
# Check Supabase status
curl -f https://api.supabase.com/v1/projects/$PROJECT_ID/health

# Verify database connectivity
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT version();"

# Check connection pool
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity;"
```

**Step 3: Application Recovery**
```bash
# Redeploy from last known good state
git checkout $(git log --oneline -n 10 | grep "Production:" | head -1 | cut -d' ' -f1)
vercel --prod

# Verify deployment
curl -f https://caregrid.vercel.app/api/health
```

**Step 4: Service Validation**
```bash
# Run health checks
npm run test:health-check

# Verify critical paths
curl -f https://caregrid.vercel.app/api/appointments
curl -f https://caregrid.vercel.app/api/clinics
curl -f https://caregrid.vercel.app/api/auth/session
```

### Scenario 2: Database Corruption/Failure

**Symptoms:**
- Database connection errors
- Data inconsistency
- Query timeouts

**Recovery Steps:**

**Step 1: Assess Damage**
```sql
-- Check database integrity
SELECT schemaname, tablename, attname, n_distinct, correlation 
FROM pg_stats 
WHERE schemaname = 'public';

-- Verify critical tables
SELECT count(*) FROM users;
SELECT count(*) FROM clinics;
SELECT count(*) FROM appointments;
```

**Step 2: Point-in-Time Recovery**
```bash
# Identify last good backup
supabase db list-backups

# Restore from backup (if needed)
supabase db restore --backup-id=$BACKUP_ID

# Verify restoration
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT max(created_at) FROM appointments;"
```

**Step 3: Data Validation**
```sql
-- Run data integrity checks
SELECT 
  table_name,
  column_name,
  is_nullable,
  data_type
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_schema = 'public'
ORDER BY table_name, ordinal_position;

-- Check referential integrity
SELECT conname, conrelid::regclass, confrelid::regclass
FROM pg_constraint
WHERE contype = 'f';
```

### Scenario 3: Security Breach

**Symptoms:**
- Unauthorized access detected
- Suspicious database queries
- Data exfiltration alerts

**Immediate Actions:**

**Step 1: Contain the Breach**
```bash
# Rotate all API keys immediately
supabase secrets set DATABASE_URL="$NEW_DATABASE_URL"
vercel env rm DATABASE_URL
vercel env add DATABASE_URL="$NEW_DATABASE_URL"

# Invalidate all user sessions
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "DELETE FROM auth.sessions;"

# Enable IP restrictions
supabase network-restrictions add --cidr="OFFICE_IP/32"
```

**Step 2: Forensic Analysis**
```sql
-- Check access logs
SELECT 
  timestamp,
  user_id,
  action,
  resource,
  ip_address
FROM audit_logs 
WHERE timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
ORDER BY timestamp DESC;

-- Identify compromised accounts
SELECT 
  u.email,
  u.last_sign_in_at,
  u.sign_in_count
FROM auth.users u
WHERE u.last_sign_in_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours';
```

**Step 3: Breach Notification**
```bash
# HIPAA breach notification (if PHI involved)
echo "Potential PHI breach detected at $(date)" | \
  mail -s "URGENT: HIPAA Breach Notification" compliance@caregrid.com

# Regulatory notification (within 72 hours)
# Document all affected records
# Prepare breach assessment report
```

### Scenario 4: Third-Party Service Failure

**Common Failures:**
- Supabase outage
- Vercel deployment issues
- Cloudinary CDN problems
- Payment processor downtime

**Recovery Steps:**

**Step 1: Activate Fallbacks**
```bash
# Switch to backup CDN
export CDN_URL="https://backup-cdn.caregrid.com"
vercel env add CDN_URL="$CDN_URL"

# Enable maintenance mode
vercel env add MAINTENANCE_MODE="true"

# Deploy maintenance page
vercel --prod
```

**Step 2: Monitor Service Status**
```bash
# Check service status pages
curl -s https://status.supabase.com/api/v2/status.json
curl -s https://www.vercel-status.com/api/v2/status.json

# Set up monitoring
while true; do
  curl -f https://api.supabase.com/v1/projects/$PROJECT_ID/health || \
    echo "Supabase still down at $(date)"
  sleep 60
done
```

## üìä Recovery Validation

### Health Check Suite

**Critical Path Testing:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# scripts/health-check.sh

echo "üîç Running post-recovery validation..."

# Test authentication
echo "Testing authentication..."
TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST https://caregrid.vercel.app/api/auth/login \
  -d '{"email":"test@caregrid.com","password":"test123"}' | \
  jq -r '.access_token')

if [ "$TOKEN" != "null" ]; then
  echo "‚úÖ Authentication working"
else
  echo "‚ùå Authentication failed"
  exit 1
fi

# Test appointment booking
echo "Testing appointment booking..."
RESPONSE=$(curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  https://caregrid.vercel.app/api/appointments)

if echo "$RESPONSE" | jq -e '.appointments' > /dev/null; then
  echo "‚úÖ Appointment system working"
else
  echo "‚ùå Appointment system failed"
  exit 1
fi

# Test clinic search
echo "Testing clinic search..."
RESPONSE=$(curl -s https://caregrid.vercel.app/api/clinics?search=dental)

if echo "$RESPONSE" | jq -e '.clinics' > /dev/null; then
  echo "‚úÖ Clinic search working"
else
  echo "‚ùå Clinic search failed"
  exit 1
fi

echo "üéâ All critical systems operational"
```

**Performance Validation:**
```bash
# Response time check
for endpoint in "/api/health" "/api/clinics" "/api/appointments"; do
  RESPONSE_TIME=$(curl -w "%{time_total}" -s -o /dev/null \
    https://caregrid.vercel.app$endpoint)
  
  if (( $(echo "$RESPONSE_TIME > 2.0" | bc -l) )); then
    echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  Slow response: $endpoint (${RESPONSE_TIME}s)"
  else
    echo "‚úÖ Fast response: $endpoint (${RESPONSE_TIME}s)"
  fi
done
```

### Data Integrity Checks

```sql
-- Verify data consistency
SELECT 
  'users' as table_name,
  count(*) as record_count,
  max(created_at) as latest_record
FROM users
UNION ALL
SELECT 
  'appointments',
  count(*),
  max(created_at)
FROM appointments
UNION ALL
SELECT 
  'clinics',
  count(*),
  max(created_at)
FROM clinics;

-- Check for orphaned records
SELECT 
  a.id,
  a.user_id,
  a.clinic_id
FROM appointments a
LEFT JOIN users u ON a.user_id = u.id
LEFT JOIN clinics c ON a.clinic_id = c.id
WHERE u.id IS NULL OR c.id IS NULL;
```

## üîÑ Backup & Recovery Strategy

### Automated Backup Schedule

**Database Backups:**
- **Continuous:** WAL-E streaming (RPO: 5 minutes)
- **Hourly:** Point-in-time snapshots
- **Daily:** Full database dump
- **Weekly:** Cross-region backup
- **Monthly:** Long-term archival

**Application Backups:**
- **Git:** All code changes tracked
- **Vercel:** Deployment history (50 deployments)
- **Environment:** Encrypted config backups
- **Assets:** CDN with multi-region replication

### Recovery Testing

**Monthly Recovery Drills:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# scripts/recovery-drill.sh

echo "üß™ Starting monthly recovery drill..."

# Create test environment
vercel env add DRILL_MODE="true" --scope=caregrid-test

# Restore from 24h old backup
BACKUP_ID=$(supabase db list-backups | grep "24 hours ago" | cut -d' ' -f1)
supabase db restore --backup-id=$BACKUP_ID --target=test-db

# Run validation suite
npm run test:recovery-validation

# Measure recovery time
echo "Recovery completed in: $(($(date +%s) - $START_TIME)) seconds"

# Cleanup test environment
vercel env rm DRILL_MODE --scope=caregrid-test
```

### Backup Validation

```sql
-- Verify backup integrity
SELECT 
  schemaname,
  tablename,
  pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename)) as size
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename) DESC;

-- Check backup freshness
SELECT 
  table_name,
  max(created_at) as latest_record,
  NOW() - max(created_at) as age
FROM (
  SELECT 'users' as table_name, max(created_at) as created_at FROM users
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 'appointments', max(created_at) FROM appointments
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 'clinics', max(created_at) FROM clinics
) t
GROUP BY table_name;
```
