# 🎯 Password Reset Email Fix - Quick Start Guide

## ✅ What's Been Fixed

Your CareGrid password reset email functionality has been configured and is ready to use. Here's what was implemented:

### Changes Made:
1. **Email Service Configuration**: Set up Gmail SMTP with your app password
2. **Environment Setup**: Created `.env` configuration with your credentials
3. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Added better debugging and error messages
4. **Testing Tools**: Created email configuration test script
5. **Documentation**: Comprehensive setup and troubleshooting guide

## 🚀 Quick Setup (2 Minutes)

1. **Update Email Address**: Edit `/backend/.env` file and replace:
   ```bash
   EMAIL_USER=YOUR_GMAIL_ADDRESS@gmail.com
   ```
   With your actual Gmail address that has the app password.

2. **Test Configuration**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run test-email your-email@example.com
   ```

3. **Start Backend**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

That's it! Your password reset emails will now be sent via Gmail.

## 🔍 How It Works

1. User clicks "Send Verification Code" on password reset form
2. System generates 6-digit code (e.g., 123456)
3. Email sent via your Gmail account to user's email address
4. Email appears from "CareGrid UK <noreply@caregriduk.co.uk>"
5. User receives professional email with verification code
6. Code expires after 15 minutes for security

## 📧 Email Configuration Details

Your current setup:
- **Service**: Gmail SMTP
- **Your App Password**: `bycozcsxrffvvazo` (configured in .env)
- **Sender Display**: "CareGrid UK <noreply@caregriduk.co.uk>"
- **Domain**: caregriduk.co.uk (as requested)

## 🧪 Testing

Use the built-in test script to verify everything works:

```bash
# Test with your own email to receive the test message
cd backend
npm run test-email your-email@gmail.com
```

The test will:
- ✅ Verify your environment configuration
- ✅ Test Gmail SMTP connection
- ✅ Send a real test email with 6-digit code

## 📁 Files Modified/Created

- `backend/.env` - Your email credentials (not committed to Git)
- `backend/.env.example` - Template for other developers
- `backend/services/emailService.js` - Enhanced error handling
- `backend/test-email-config.js` - Email testing tool
- `EMAIL_SETUP.md` - Detailed configuration guide

## 🔒 Security Notes

- Your `.env` file is in `.gitignore` (credentials protected)
- Using Google App Password (more secure than regular password)
- Verification codes expire after 15 minutes
- Only one active code per user at a time

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

If emails aren't sending:

1. **Run the test**: `npm run test-email your-email@gmail.com`
2. **Check Gmail Settings**:
   - 2FA must be enabled
   - App password must be active
   - Account not locked or suspended
3. **Verify Environment**: Make sure `EMAIL_USER` has your actual Gmail address
