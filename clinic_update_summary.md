## Issues Encountered

### Database Permission Issues
- **Row-Level Security (RLS)**: The Supabase database has row-level security policies that prevent insertions with the current API key
- **Update Limitations**: Even successful HTTP responses for updates didn't persist the data
- **API Key Permissions**: The anonymous API key appears to have read-only access or restricted write permissions

### Recommendations
1. **Database Admin Access**: Use a service role key or admin credentials to bypass RLS policies
2. **Manual Database Updates**: Update records directly through the Supabase dashboard
3. **Policy Review**: Review and adjust RLS policies to allow legitimate data updates
4. **Batch Import**: Use Supabase's CSV import feature in the dashboard

## Files Created
- `clinic_updates.csv` - Original clinic data in CSV format
- `update_clinics.py` - Script for updating existing records
- `insert_new_clinics.py` - Script for inserting new records
- `clinic_update_summary.md` - This summary document

## Next Steps
To complete the clinic data updates, you'll need to either:
1. Use database admin credentials
2. Manually import the data through the Supabase dashboard
3. Adjust the database security policies to allow these operations

All clinic information has been verified and is ready for import once the permission issues are resolved.
