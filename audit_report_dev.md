  - Test VPN/secure connection requirements

- [ ] **Environment Variable Security**
  - Audit .env.development file for exposed secrets
  - Verify JWT_SECRET is development-only (not production key)
  - Check Supabase keys are properly scoped for development
  - Validate CORS_ORIGINS are restrictive (localhost only)

**Test Commands:**
```bash
# Check development environment isolation
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health
# Should only work in development mode

# Audit environment variables
grep -r "production\|prod" .env.development
# Should return no matches for production credentials

# Verify development database connection
psql postgresql://caregrid_user:password@localhost:5432/caregrid_dev -c "SELECT version();"
# Should connect to local development database only
```

### Code Quality & Security

- [ ] **Dependency Security**
  - Audit npm dependencies for known vulnerabilities
  - Check for outdated healthcare-critical packages (@supabase/supabase-js, jsonwebtoken)
  - Verify integrity of third-party healthcare integrations
  - Review package-lock.json for supply chain security

**Test Commands:**
```bash

# Static code analysis for security issues
eslint js/ --ext .js --config .eslintrc-security.json

# Search for potential security issues in code
grep -r "password\|token\|secret\|key" js/ --exclude-dir=node_modules
```
